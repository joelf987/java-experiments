The Aston Martin DB11 is a two-door grand touring car.
It was manufactured as both a coupe and a convertible, the latter known as the Volante.
The British carmaker Aston Martin produced the DB11 from 2016 to 2023 when it was replaced by the DB12.
The DB11 succeeded the DB9, which the company made between 2004 and 2016.
Designed by Marek Reichman, who became lead designer in May 2005, the DB11 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2016.
The first model of Aston Martin's "second-century plan", the DB11—like its predecessor and its platform siblings—incorporates aluminium extensively throughout its body.
